This is a fork of the SPARQL Views Drupal module adding some extra functionality required by the CURIOS project (http://www.dotrural.ac.uk/curios). It also incorporates various fixes and compatibility with the latest Views 7.x-3.x branch.

For more information about SPARQL Views please check out the README.txt or the Drupal.org project at http://drupal.org/project/sparql_views.
